# BrewIt
BrewIt! It's like the old "CheckIt!" DOS utility, but for Qualcomm BREW 3.1.x!

Check the screen resolution and color depth!
Get the phone's Platform ID! Find out how much ram the phone has!
Benchmark your phone's CPU!
Start applets by class id and URI!
Dump portions of ram! Check the CPSR register!
Copy files! Dump and decrypt all of the MIF files on the phone!
List directories!

# Building snag.
Qualcomm being Qualcomm, the SDK documentation says nothing about "cig" files.

As such, you need to open the compiled mif file in the old BREW mif editor and select the "System" permission and click save. This enables all permissions.

If you DO know how to set applet permissions in a "cif" file please tell me!
