# BrewIt
BrewIt! It's like the old "CheckIt!" DOS utility, but for Qualcomm BREW 3.1.x!

# Building snag.
Qualcomm being Qualcomm, the SDK documentation says nothing about "cig" files.

As such, you need to open the compiled mif file in the old BREW mif editor and select the "System" permission and click save. This enables all permissions.

If you DO know how to set applet permissions in a "cif" file please tell me!
